The Human Risky Decision-Making (HURD) toolkit was developed from
code and ideas originally proposed in the following paper:

    Peterson, J. C., Bourgin, D. D., Agrawal, M., Reichman, D., &
    Griffiths, T. L. (2021). Using large-scale experiments and
    machine learning to discover theories of human decision-making.
    Science, 372(6547), 1209-1214.
    
It is the joint creation of Joshua C. Peterson and David D. Bourgin,
under the advisorship of Thomas L. Griffiths.
